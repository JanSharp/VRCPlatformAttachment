- [ ] things to test
  - [ ] set up synced animations in order to actually be able to test stuff
  - [ ] people with ping would lag behind more and more as time passes
  - [ ] having low frame rate break the system too
    - [ ] make a script that intentionally lowers frame rate using busy waits and stopwatches
- [ ] find a way to prevent ik drift (legs sliding diagonally behind remote players) for everybody who isn't in full body
  - only option I've seen so far is using the immobilize flag. That would mean manually implementing all movement while being attached to a platform
