- [ ] things to test
  - [x] set up synced animations in order to actually be able to test stuff
  - [ ] people with ping would lag behind more and more as time passes
  - [ ] having low frame rate break the system too
    - [x] make a script that intentionally lowers frame rate using busy waits and stopwatches
- [x] ~~find a way to prevent ik drift (legs sliding diagonally behind remote players) for everybody who isn't in full body~~
  - ~~only option I've seen so far is using the immobilize flag. That would mean manually implementing all movement while being attached to a platform~~
  - By using stations this luckily becomes a non issue. Legs are no longer drifting behind, and moving around plays the walking animation. Like this is genuine luck
- [ ] testing with 2 people in desktop works just fine, in live session with 40+ people it broke
- [ ] the station approach requires implementing gravity, velocity and jumping manually
